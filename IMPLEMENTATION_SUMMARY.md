### Core Implementation Files:
1. **`linkedin_scraper/objects.py`** - Added `Post` dataclass
2. **`linkedin_scraper/person.py`** - Added posts functionality to Person class
3. **`linkedin_scraper/__init__.py`** - Updated exports to include Post class

### Usage Scripts:
4. **`scrape_posts.py`** - Standalone posts scraping script
5. **`scrape_shashank_profile.py`** - Updated to include posts scraping
6. **`test_posts_scraping.py`** - Test suite for validation

### Documentation:
7. **`POSTS_SCRAPING_README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
8. **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary file

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Method 1: Standalone Posts Scraper
```bash
# Set up credentials
export LINKEDIN_EMAIL='your-email@example.com'
export LINKEDIN_PASSWORD='your-password'

# Run the posts scraper
python3 scrape_posts.py
```

### Method 2: Full Profile + Posts
```bash
# Run the enhanced profile scraper (includes posts)
python3 scrape_shashank_profile.py
```

### Method 3: Programmatic Usage
```python
from linkedin_scraper import Person
from selenium import webdriver

# Setup driver and login
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
person = Person('https://www.linkedin.com/in/username/', driver=driver)

# Scrape posts from last 24 hours
person.get_posts(hours_limit=24)

# Access the posts
for post in person.posts:
    print(f"Content: {post.content}")
    print(f"Engagement: {post.likes_count} likes, {post.comments_count} comments")
```

## üìä Data Extracted

For each post within the last 24 hours, the module extracts:

- **Content**: Full text content of the post
- **Posted Date**: Relative time (e.g., "2h ago", "1d ago")
- **Engagement Metrics**:
  - Likes count
  - Comments count  
  - Shares/reposts count
- **Media Information**: Type of media (text, image, video, document)
- **Author Details**: Name and profile URL
- **Post URL**: Direct link to the post

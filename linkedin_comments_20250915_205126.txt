Content: We’re Hiring: Cyber Security Intern @ Matters.ai

At Matters.ai, we’re building the future of AI-powered data security and we’re looking for a curious, driven individuals to join us on this journey.
This isn’t your typical internship. You’ll get hands on experience solving real security challenges protecting sensitive data across cloud, endpoints, and SaaS tools.

What you’ll do:
-> Design and test real security policies
-> Support pen-testing & vulnerability assessments
-> Research new attack techniques and how to stop them
-> Contribute to red-team exercises & incident response
-> Learn how companies align with frameworks like ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, RBI, SEBI

Who we’re looking for:
-> Someone passionate about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, or data security
-> Familiar with tools like Burp Suite, Kali Linux, Wireshark (extra points for Metasploit, Ghidra, reverse engineering)
-> Curious about AI security, adversarial ML, or malware analysis
-> Bonus if you’ve done bug bounty or tinkered with exploits for fun

You’ll work alongside experienced security engineers, explore advanced threats, and help us build security-first AI systems while sharpening skills that will launch your cybersecurity career.

Content: Your next DFIR teammate isn’t human — it’s an LLM agent.

That’s exactly what I built: the Agentic Digital Forensics Toolkit.

An AI forensics agent that guides, explains, and collects evidence

15-phase methodology → memory, processes, network, logs, filesystem
50+ validated commands with built-in safety controls

Automated, tamper-proof reports and chain of custody

This is more than automation — it’s agentic security in action.

From incident response to classrooms, LLM-powered agents are redefining how we do digital forensics.

Forensics, powered by AI agents. ⚡

Content: 🚀 Exploring AI Agents in GoLang

GoLang has always been one of my favourite languages for building projects. Recently, while exploring whether AI agents could be built in Go, I came across agent-sdk-go ->

That inspired me to experiment — and I ended up building a GoLang AI agent that generates unit test cases (works best with Gin framework projects).
⚡ Capabilities
🧪 Generates unit tests for functions with maximum coverage
📂 Automatically creates a test file in the correct directory
🔍 Uses an agentic function tool powered by Go’s AST types to fetch dependent files

While the generated tests may still need a bit of refactoring and fine-tuning, this tool provides a strong head start—saving valuable time compared to writing tests from scratch.
👉 Check it out here:

💡 Next step I’m considering: adding a test validator agent to ensure the generated test cases are not just comprehensive, but also reliable and high quality.
Would love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or ideas for improvements!

      "content": "🚀 Exploring AI Agents in GoLang\n\nGoLang has always been one of my favourite languages for building projects. Recently, while exploring whether AI agents could be built in Go, I came across agent-sdk-go ->\n\nThat inspired me to experiment — and I ended up building a GoLang AI agent that generates unit test cases (works best with Gin framework projects).\n⚡ Capabilities\n🧪 Generates unit tests for functions with maximum coverage\n📂 Automatically creates a test file in the correct directory\n🔍 Uses an agentic function tool powered by Go’s AST types to fetch dependent files\n\nWhile the generated tests may still need a bit of refactoring and fine-tuning, this tool provides a strong head start—saving valuable time compared to writing tests from scratch.\n👉 Check it out here:\n\n💡 Next step I’m considering: adding a test validator agent to ensure the generated test cases are not just comprehensive, but also reliable and high quality.\nWould love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or ideas for improvements!\n…more",
